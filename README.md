  Pedal Maps is an Android and IOS application capable of finding a users location and recording a bike trail they 
imbark on. As the user travels, polylines are drawn onto the map as well as a timer and milage to track. When the ride is 
complete the user can save the ride. The user can give the trail a name, rating, and gravel type. The trail is saved to firebase 
and can then be viewed on the nearby trails screen. The nearby trails screen shows the complete trail, along with bullet points.
